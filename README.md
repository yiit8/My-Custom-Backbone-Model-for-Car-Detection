 In this project i tried to create an object detection model to predict 8 different classes of vehicles
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I had two different datasets. One for object detection who had 8 classes, the other one for classification who had 2 classes
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 As a starting point i thought like i would train a classification model, then use the weights of this model to fine-tune an object detection model
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 But i went with difficult way, labeled 2000 classification images with labellmg and combined my two datasets to create a new dataset.
